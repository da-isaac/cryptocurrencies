# cryptocurrencies

## Overview
The purpose of this report was to analyze crytocurrency data and try to identify basic patterns for various crytocurrencies to determine if it was worth investing in.

## Results
It was determined that the most desirable number of classes for the data was 4, using the elbow curve to discover this. 
Once data was classified and coin data was standardized, there are two outliers that seem to be worth noting - 
BitTorrent has a "TotalCoinsMined" value of 1 and a "TotalCoinSupply" value of 0.990. This seems to suggest that the coin supply has reached its limit and it doesn't make sense to invest in.
However, TurtleCoin has "TotalCoinSupply" value of 1 and a "TotalCoinsMined" value of 5.368e-2, far more than any of the other coins in both values. It seems that this may be one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in based on this initial analysis.
